## [Demo](https://waterrmalann.github.io/fancy-fonts-generator/)   |   [Source](https://github.com/waterrmalann/fancy-fonts-generator/blob/main/js/converter.js)

A super-simple web app that you can use to generate cool, weird, and beautiful text using pseudofonts made with Unicode characters. This is the GUI-based equivalent of the [Fancy Fonts Bot](https://github.com/waterrmalann/telegram-fancy-fonts-bot) for Telegram that I wrote not too long ago. They are both similar in terms of functionality and the font system is cross-compatible.

**Note:** *Text generated using this application may not always be readable, they could also cause accessibility issues as screen-readers might not recognize them. So it is advised that you use them knowing the downsides.*
